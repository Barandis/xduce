  <h1>Transducer theory: Generalizing iteration and reduction</h1>
  <p><em>
    This page could easily be regarded as optional. There isn't anything in here that will tell you how
    to use xduce. But if you're interested in why you're using xduce, or what's going on under the
    covers, then you might find this page satisfying. I found it satisfying to write it.
  </em></p>
  <p><em>
    Also, it's pretty long. There's a lot to explain, and since I'm assuming no prior knowledge of any of this
    transducer business, I want to explain it thoroughly. I even cover something that don't work to make it clear why
    we do the things that do work. Because it's so long, it's broken into three sections.

  <h2>Transducer? What's that?</h2>
  <p>
    That's a great question. But it's a difficult one to answer without some background. Suffice it for the
    moment to say that transducers provide a different way to transform collections. In order to figure out
    what's so different and why that difference is good, we're going to start with a traditional list function.
    We'll learn a bit about it, and then we'll see what we need to do to morph it into a transducer and duscuss
    why those changes are good.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      I'm not sure that there's a well-established word for "those composable functions that exist in functional
      programming languages that let you manipulate the elements of a collection to produce a new collection".
      For the purpose of this page I'm going to just call them <strong>list functions</strong>, which isn't
      exactly right but also isn't exactly wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      These functions came to prominence in list-based functional programming languages, but they've  long since
      been taken into many languages &mdash; like JavaScript &mdash; that are <em>not</em> list based.
      Nevertheless, there are problems with just about every other name I could give them, so we'll just agree
      that "list functions" can operate on collections that aren't lists and go with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not satisfied with "list function" but until someone comes up with something better, that's what
      I'll call them.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    Maybe the quintessential list function is <code>map</code>, so let's start our look there. In JavaScript,
    there is a function property named <code>map</code> on the <code>Array</code> object, and it's normally
    invoked like this:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(x => x + 1);
    // -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    So what <code>map</code> is doing here is 1) breaking apart a collection (in this case,
    <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>), 2) feeding the values from the collection to a function
    (<code>x => x + 1</code>) to get new values, and 3) putting those values together into a new collection
    (which turns out to be <code>[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code>). This is great. It's very useful, and <code>map</code>
    gets used all the time, whether overtly or behind the scenes in a library somewhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    But is it really so great? We have a couple of ideas in programming called the <strong>single responsibility
    principle</strong> and <strong>loose coupling</strong>. The former suggests that any software unit (like a
    module, class, or function) should be responsible for exactly one concern. The latter suggests that it's best
    if any particular unit knows as little as possible about other units. These are good principles because they
    make it much more likely that software produced with them in mind is modular and maintainable.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>map</code>, as well as just about every other list function, violates both of these principles. It
    <em>should</em> have a single concern: mapping. Yet it also concerns itself with breaking a list apart and
    putting it back together, things that have nothing to do with mapping. And because it implements that
    breaking apart and putting back together without allowing for any customization, it's inextricably linked to
    arrays, which breaks loose coupling.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      In fairness, languages with typeclasses or generics (JavaScript is not one of these) do better with loose
      coupling on list functions, though they still violate single responsibility.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    As if that wasn't enough, it's very important that list functions be <strong>composable</strong>, meaning
    that they should be able to be chained together to accomplish more complex manipulations. And while list
    functions do in fact tend to be composable, they do it in a highly inefficient way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's take a moment to summarize the issues with <code>map</code> and, by extension, all of its list function
    brethren.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      It violates the single-responsibility principle by deconstructing the input array and constructing a new
      output array, when it really should only be doing mapping.
    </li>
    <li>
      It violates loose coupling by tying itself directly to the array, disallowing working with any other data
      structure.
    </li>
    <li>
      It composes, but in an inefficient way (I'll describe what's inefficient about <code>map</code>'s
      composition a little later).
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Having described all that baggage, let's see now what we can do to <code>map</code> to make these problems
    go away. We will do that by slowly morphing the <code>map</code> list function into a <code>map</code>
    <strong>transducer</strong>, which doesn't suffer from tight coupling, multiple responsibilities, or
    inefficient composition. Along the way, we'll learn exactly what a transducer is and how it's different from
    a list function.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      You're welcome to trust that the code in the examples throughout this page is correct and that you
      understand it perfectly just by reading it. If you don't feel so confident in either of those premises,
      then feel free to type it directly into a browser console (hit F12 in Chrome, for instance, which is what I
      did when I was writing this). If you have Node.js installed, you can also run all of this code in the REPL.
    </p>
    <p>
      The code is written to be usable by typing it all in from beginning to end, all three parts included, which is
      why you're bound to see a lot of <code>let</code>s where there might normally be <code>const</code>s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which reminds me, it's all ES2015. If you're typing this into Internet Explorer's console, do not expect
      good results.

  <h2>Iteration, transformation, reduction</h2>
  <p>
    We've observed that <code>map</code> is doing three things. In fact, we have names for these three things.
    The part where the input collection is broken into pieces is called <strong>iteration</strong>. The part
    where the pieces are changed is called <strong>transformation</strong>. And the part where the transformed
    pieces are put back together again is called <strong>reduction</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    With <code>map</code> &mdash; a function that <em>should</em> just be doing transformation but is also doing
    iteration and reduction &mdash; the programmer only has control over the transformation step. Any function
    at all can be passed to <code>map</code>, and <code>map</code> will duly pass all elements into this mapping
    function and collect its return values for the output collection. The iteration and reduction are hard-coded.
    We would definitely like to get rid of this restriction, not only because the hard-coding is the worst kind
    of tight coupling, but also because if we can loosely couple these two steps then it's easy to move
    responsibility for them somewhere else.
  </p>
  <p>
    But enough talk. We want to generalize the iteration and reduction that <code>map</code> is doing. Let's see
    how we can go about that, starting with iteration.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Generalized iteration</h2>
  <p>
    In fact, this is really the easy part. JavaScript already does it for us, at least as of ES2015. That's when
    <strong>protocols</strong> entered the language, and it so happens that two of the first batch of protocols
    to be added were the <em>iteration</em> protocols. Sounds promising.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're interested in the gory details,
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols">read about
    them on the Mozilla Developer Network</a>. The gist is that if a collection can conform to these protocols,
    it gains the ability to be used in one of the new ES2015 constructs, the <code>for...of</code> loop.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>for...of</code> loop breaks apart a collection into its components and runs through the loop one
    time for each component. Sound familiar? It's iteration. And the iteration protocols are built-in for
    JavaScript arrays, strings, and generators. They can also be defined by programmers, and several third-party
    collection libraries implement them. Let's take a look at some examples.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      In all of the examples on this page, I will be using the variable name <code>xs</code> to refer to a
      collection. This is pronounced "exes" and is literally meant to be the plural of <code>x</code>, which is
      a single element in the collection. This is a common convention in functional programming.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let result = [];
    for (const x of xs) {
      result.push(x + 1);
    }
    result;
    // -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    That's mapping an array using <code>for...of</code>. What about other input collections, like strings?
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    xs = 'hello';
    result = [];
    for (const x of xs) {
      result.push(x.toUpperCase());
    }
    result;
    // -> ["H", "E", "L", "L", "O"]
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    This will work for any collection with the iterator protocols implemented, and a good example of a collection
    like that is the <code>List</code> from <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">Immutable</a>, a
    third-party library of immutable data structures. If you want to be certain, you can type the following code
    into the console after making sure that Immutable is loaded into the page you're viewing in the browser. This
    will not work if you haven't loaded a page with Immutable in it, but if you don't have one, you can just skip
    it and trust that this works.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    xs = Immutable.List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    result = [];
    for (const x of xs) {
      result.push(x + 1);
    }
    result;
    // -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    So the same construct is used to break down any collection (at least, any collection that implements the
    iteration protocols, which we'll assume from now on even without saying it) into its pieces. In fact, it's so
    regular that we can abstract that away and make it a function that works with any kind of input collection.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    function map1(xs, fn) {
      const result = [];
      for (const x of xs) {
        result.push(fn(x));
      }
      return result;
    }

    map1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], x => x + 1);
    // -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    map1('hello', x => x.toUpperCase());
    // -> ['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O']
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    So we've already written a function that can map <em>any</em> kind of input collection, but it always returns
    an array. This is because the reduction step in our new function amounts to pushing the transformed result
    into an array, a process that remains hard-coded. We could change this reduction step to anything we want to
    &mdash; string concatentation, creating a new immutable list, yielding out of a generator &mdash; but
    whatever we change it to, it'll still be hard-coded. We haven't yet made our reduction generalized. Let's
    look at that next.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Generalized Reduction</h2>
  <p>
    Reduction is a pretty familiar concept to a lot of programmers; in fact, the same <code>Array</code> object
    where <code>map</code> is defined also defines a <code>reduce</code> function. Let's take a look at it in
    action.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].reduce((acc, x) => {
      acc.push(x + 1);
      return acc;
    }, []);
    // -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    What this code is doing is...well, it's exactly the same as the first example on this page. It's
    <code>map</code>, defined in terms of <code>reduce</code>. (Interestingly, you can define pretty much any
    list function in terms of <code>reduce</code>, but that's a subject for another time.)
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>reduce</code> function itself works with three pieces of information: the input collection, a
    <strong>reducer function</strong>, and an <strong>initial value</strong>. The reducer function is what
    actually builds the output collection. It takes two arguments: the current, unfinished output (often called
    the <strong>accumulator</strong>, which is why I name it <code>acc</code>) and the next element of the input
    collection. Its job is to process that element however it needs to and join it with the accumulator to create
    an updated accumulator. Once all of the elements have been processed, that final accumulator is what's
    returned from the <code>reduce</code> function.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      A <em>reducer function</em> is actually a thing with a specific definition. It is a function that takes an
      accumulator and a new value, and it returns a new accumulator with the new value incorporated. In other
      words, it's a function that's suitable for passing to the <code>reduce</code> list function. We will use
      them quite a bit before the end.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    The initial value is there because, on the very first invocation of the reducer function, there <em>is no</em>
    accumulator. After all, the function hasn't been run yet to produce one. So on that first go, the initial
    value is sent to the reducer function as the accumulator.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thing is, if you squint just right, you can see both of these new ideas &mdash; a reducer function and an
    initial value &mdash; in our <code>map1</code> function from the last section. Let's look at the function
    again.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    function map1(xs, fn) {
      const result = [];
      for (const x of xs) {
        result.push(fn(x));
      }
      return result;
    }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    That value that's assigned to <code>result</code> sure does look like an initial value, and the body of the
    <code>for...of</code> loop looks an awful lot like the reduction function. Now that we've identified these
    aspects that are playing a part in reduction, let's see if we can abstract them out.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    function map2(xs, fn, reducer, init) {
      let acc = init;
      for (const x of xs) {
        acc = reducer(acc, fn(x));
      }
      return acc;
    }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    That looks pretty good. There is nothing hard-coded at all; the reducer function, the initial value, the
    transformer function, and the collection are all passed in as arguments. The <code>for...of</code> loop handles the
    iteration. Inside of it, the <code>reducer</code> function is passed the current accumulator (which is set as the
    initial value the first time through) and the transformed next value in the collection, and it returns a new
    accumulator. When the iteration is complete, the last value of the accumulator is returned as the result. This
    sounds <em>exactly</em> like our <code>reduce</code>-driven mapping above.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's try it out. Note <code>arrayReducer</code> and <code>stringReducer</code> &mdash; these are perfectly
    normal reducer functions and are not specific to this code. We will use them later, exactly as they're
    presented here.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    function arrayReducer(acc, x) {
      acc.push(x);
      return acc;
    }
    function stringReducer(acc, x) {
      return acc + x;
    }

    map2([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], x => x + 1, arrayReducer, []);
    // -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    map2('hello', x => x + x, stringReducer, '');
    // -> "hheelllloo"

    // Interesting side effect of separating iteration and
    // reduction: we can iterate differently than we reduce,
    // meaning different input and output collection types
    map2([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], x => x + 1, stringReducer, '');
    // -> "23456"
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Great! <code>map2</code> looks really nice so far. It <em>only</em> deals with transformation; the
    iteration (via the iteration protocols on the input collection) and the reduction (via the reducer function
    and initial value that we pass to it) are handled by other code that's meant to handle them. What's more, as
    the last example shows, this same function will accept any kind of input collection and produce any kind of
    output collection, <em>even if they're different.</em>. Let's see your list function do that.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're getting a little better idea of transducers now. They have to do with separating a regular list
    function into its single-concern parts so that we have more flexibility in how to call them in order to get
    the transformation we want. But that stuff is all adjectives, describing some characteristics of transducers,
    not telling us what a transducer really <em>is</em>. To get there, we're going to have to look at our third
    problem with list functions &mdash; inefficient composition &mdash; and solve it. We'll look at that on the next
    page.
