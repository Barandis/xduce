  <h1>Transducer theory: Experiments in composition</h1>
  <p><em>
    In the first part of this series, <a href="#manual/theory/generalizing">Generalizing iteration and reduction</a>,
    we worked out how to remove two of the three steps in transforming collections from the transformer functions
    themselves. This leaves us with transformer functions that do transformations and nothing else.
  </em></p>
  <p><em>
    In this part, we are going to look in to how to accomplish the third improvement over normal list functions:
    composition.

  <h2>Decomposing composition</h2>
  <p>
    I mentioned earlier that composition is really important for list functions. You wouldn't know it from
    looking at the JavaScript spec &mdash; you won't find a <code>compose</code> function or anything like it in
    there anywhere &mdash; but that doesn't mean we can't work with it ourselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's give an example. This takes <code>Array</code>'s functions <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>
    and turns them inside out, which makes it more convenient to do composition.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    function arrayMap(fn, xs) {
      return xs => xs.map(fn);
    }
    function arrayFilter(fn, xs) {
      return xs => xs.filter(fn);
    }

    function compose(...fns) {
      return fns.reduce((f, g) => value => f(g(value)));
    }

    let mapAndFilter = compose(arrayMap(x => x + 1), arrayFilter(x => x > 3));
    mapAndFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
    // -> [5, 6]
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    This demonstrates a couple of things. First of all, it's convoluted to turn a JavaScript list function into
    an easily composable function, but it can be done. If you had to compose these functions, you'd probaly do it
    with chaining like <a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a> does, but that isn't quite the same and doesn't
    really help us as much with our understanding.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      If you're really interested in why <code>arrayMap</code> and <code>arrayFilter</code> are coded like they
      are: they're done like this to enable partial function application. If you wanted to actually call
      <code>arrayMap</code>, you would do it like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">
      arrayMap(x => x + 1)([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Yes, that's two sets of function parameters. That means that if I choose to only provide the first set of
      arguments, like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">
      arrayMap(x => x + 1);
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      ...then I get back a function that takes a collection and maps it over <code>x => x + 1</code>. This is
      called <strong>partial application</strong>, meaning we provide a function <em>some</em> of the arguments
      it expects, but not <em>all</em> of them. In response, the function returns another function that takes
      the rest of the arguments that we <em>didn't</em> provide. The reason for the unwieldy syntax is that
      JavaScript doesn't actually have partial application, but we can fake it with multiple parameter lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see partial application used in the call to <code>compose</code>. That's because
      <code>compose</code> only wants functions that accept one argument, the collection that they're going to
      work on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other languages support partial application and make this a lot more natural. We do what we can. You need
      never worry about it again, at least for the rest of this discussion.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    More importantly, it shows that when you call <code>compose</code>, you get back another function that does
    all of the things that the functions inside the <code>compose</code> call do. This function here is called
    <code>mapAndFilter</code>. You'll notice from the result that <code>arrayFilter</code> must have been called
    first; this right-to-left flow is typical of function composition (and there are good reasons for it).
  </p>
  <p>
    But here's the thing. This is composing list functions. List functions, like we complained about earlier, do
    <em>all</em> the work, including iterating over the input collection and reducing to the output collection.
    This means that when you call <code>mapAndFilter</code>, this is what's happening, in order:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><code>arrayFilter</code> breaks the input array into its parts</li>
    <li><code>arrayFilter</code> filters out the parts that aren't greater than 3</li>
    <li><code>arrayFilter</code> puts what's left into a new array</li>
    <li><code>arrayMap</code> breaks the new array into its parts</li>
    <li><code>arrayMap</code> adds 1 to each of these parts</li>
    <li><code>arrayMap</code> puts what's left into another new array</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <em>Steps 3 and 4 are completely unnecessary.</em> All they do is put together a new array and immediately
    break it apart again. That's a lot of extra work if those arrays are large, and it multiplies by the number
    of functions that you compose. This is what I meant earlier when I said that composition was inefficient and
    that this was a problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we were to compose our current <code>map2</code> function with another similar function, we would suffer
    the same consequences. We will want to do something about this, but we have to think about how to do it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason why this isn't easy is because each function needs to know what it's supposed to do depending on
    its context. If <code>map2</code> is called by itself, it needs to iterate over its input and reduce its
    output. But if it's called in a composition pipeline, it only needs to iterate if it's the <em>first</em>
    function in the pipeline, and it only needs to reduce if it's the <em>last</em> function in the pipeline. To
    compose properly, <code>map2</code> needs to know the context in which its called.
  </p>
  <p>
    And this is anathema. We've spent a lot of words already trying to coax a map function into not caring
    about the details of its invocation, into focusing on one thing and one thing alone: transforming values. Now
    we want to ask it to care about the details of its invocation and to care about whether or not to iterate or
    reduce.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Not abstract enough</h2>
  <p>
    The answer, maybe somewhat surprisingly, is that we haven't abstracted iteration and reduction away quite
    enough yet. Sure, the iteration and reduction happens elsewhere, but our <code>map2</code> function is still
    <em>calling</em> that code. The iteration protocol functions are being called by <code>for...of</code>, and
    the <code>reducer</code> function is being called explicitly. And as long as <code>map2</code> is responsible
    for making those calls, it has to be the one to decide whether to make them at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    We don't want to make <code>map2</code> have to understand the context in which it's called so it can figure
    out whether to iterate and whether to reduce. We want it only to accept an input, transform it, and pass it
    along to the next function in the chain. We're going to leave the iteration and reduction to a different
    function, a helper function.
  </p>
  <p>
    So let's give it a try. We're going to write a helper function that will handle when to call the iterator, the
    transformer, and the reducer. To support composition, it will take multiple transformers and call them in order,
    passing the result of one to the input of the next, and then pass the final transformed value to the reducer.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    function map3(fn) {
      return x => fn(x);
    }

    function transform3(xs, xforms, reducer, init) {
      let acc = init;
      for (const x of xs) {
        let value = x;
        for (const xform of xforms) {
          value = xform(value);
        }
        acc = reducer(acc, value);
      }
      return acc;
    }

    // TOLD you we'd use arrayReducer again
    transform3([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [map(x => x + 1)], arrayReducer, []);
    // -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    // Works for multiple transformers too
    transform3([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [map(x => x + 1), map(x => x * 2)], arrayReducer, []);
    // -> [4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Great! Now our transformer is the kind of thing we're looking for &mdash; it takes an input, transforms it, and
    returns the transformed value. It doesn't call the iterator, it doesn't call the reducer &mdash; it doesn't even
    care whether an iterator or reducer exists. It maps. That's all it does.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice the form of the <code>map3</code> function. It's basically a function that configures and returns
    <em>another</em> function. By doing this pre-loading of the mapping function (<code>fn</code>), we can make sure
    that the helper function can treat every transformer the same: it passes a value to it and expects a value back.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speaking of that helper function &mdash; well, it's not so good, when we look at it closely. In fact it suffers
    from two fatal flaws.
  </p>
  <p>
    One is that this is an ugly way to do composition. The idea is that a composition of more than one function should
    look exactly like another function, just one that does all of the things that all of the functions that it's made
    of does. This doesn't look like a function. It looks like an array of functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second problem is that it doesn't really work. Sure, it works fine with this <code>map3</code> function, but
    truth be told, a <code>map</code> function is about the best-behaved transformer function you can have. By its very
    nature, it returns one value for every value that is passed to it. But what if we use a different transformer
    function, one that does <em>not</em> return a value for every value it receives? These are not exotic;
    <code>filter</code> is a function that doesn't always return a value. Let's see how that works.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    function filter3(fn) {
      return x => {
        if (fn(x)) {
          return x;
        }
      };
    }

    transform3([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [filter(x => x > 3)], arrayReducer, []);
    // -> [undefined, undefined, undefined, 4, 5]
    transform3([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [map(x => x + 1), filter(x => x > 3)], arrayReducer, []);
    // -> [undefined, undefined, 4, 5, 6]
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Uh oh! The problem here is prety obvious. The way we've set up <code>transform3</code>, it expects there to be an
    output from the transformer array for each iteration through the input collection. But <code>filter3</code> doesn't
    <em>want</em> to provide a value for every iteration. So on the iterations where no value is provided, we get those
    <code>undefined</code>s contaminating our output.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a sticky problem to solve, and it'll take some work, but we'll deal with it on the next page.
