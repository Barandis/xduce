  <h1>More transduction</h1>
  <p>
    Back on <a href="#manual/basic/transduction">the first page of this section</a>, we saw how to use
    <code>transduce</code>, <code>into</code>, <code>sequence</code>, and transducer shortcuts to perform transduction.
    Now that we've seen all of the transducers <em>and</em> all of the built-in support for collections, we can look
    at a few other transduction functions that haven't been mentioned yet.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>High level</h2>
  <p>
    There is one function for each kind of output supported natively by xduce. These are all like <code>sequence</code>
    except that the output is a specific collection type, rather than being whatever the input collection type is. Let's
    look at them.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h3><code>asArray</code></h3>
    <p>
      This function always produces an array for output, whatever the input type.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">
      const vowel = x => 'aeiou'.includes(x);
      asArray('hello world', filter(vowel));
      // -> ["e", "o", "o"]
    </code></pre>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3><code>asObject</code></h3>
    <p>
      This function always produces an object, whatever the input. If the input wasn't an object &mdash; meaning there
      are no keys in the input collection &mdash; then keys will be created which are string representations of the
      index of that element.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">
      const vowel = x => 'aeiou'.includes(x);
      asObject('hello world', filter(vowel));
      // -> { 0: "e", 1: "o", 2: "o" }
    </code></pre>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3><code>asString</code></h3>
    <p>
      This function always produces a string. This is relatively straightforward, but it should be noted that it
      doesn't work well with object inputs. Objects have two pieces of information to encode &mdash; the key and the
      value &mdash; and it's difficult to come up with a general and useful way to encode them into a string.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">
      asString([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], map(x => x + 1));
      // -> "23456"
    </code></pre>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3><code>asIterator</code></h3>
    <p>
      Produces an iterator for output, whatever the kind of input. This function is arguably the most important of the
      four, because it's the only one that can't be replicated by <code>into</code>. It's also the only way of
      producing an iterator out of another type of input short of using <code>iterator</code> to turn the input into
      an iterator directly.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">
      const result = asIterator([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], map(x => x + 1));
      result.next();   // -> { value: 2, done: false }
      result.next();   // -> { value: 3, done: false }
      result.next();   // -> { value: 4, done: false }
      result.next();   // -> { value: 5, done: false }
      result.next();   // -> { value: 6, done: false }
      result.next();   // -> { done: true }
    </code></pre>

  <h2>The lowest level: <code>reduce</code> and <code>toReducer</code></h2>
  <p><em>
    (This section deals with a low-level function that seldom sees actual use outside of the library itself. You can
    feel free to skip this section, or to not feel bad if you read it and don't quite understand why it might be
    useful. Anything that's important in this section will be covered later, so you won't miss anything.)
  </em></p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, all transduction boils down to reduction, and xduce does provide a <code>reduce</code> function. As you
    might expect by now, it takes a collection, a reducer, and an initial value. But here's a little secret, something
    worth revealing now that we're at the lowest level of transduction: xduce doesn't really deal with reducer
    <em>functions</em>. Instead, it works with reducer <em>objects</em>. The reason for this will be made clear later
    when we talk about protocols and supporting arbitrary collection types, but for the moment, let it suffice that
    we need a way to make a reducer object that <code>reduce</code> will understand.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      Why is this just coming up now? Mostly because the only other function that we've seen that uses a reducer,
      <code>transduce</code>, will automatically create a reducer object out of a reducer function if that's what you
      provide it. <code>reduce</code> remains low-level though and does no such thing.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    It so happens that there is a function, <code>toReducer</code>, that can turn a reducer function into a reducer
    object. Not only that, it can create a reducer object for arrays, objects, or strings if you provide one of those
    instead of a function.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      It can also create a reducer object for an arbitrary collection that has been made to support transduction, but
      again, we'll talk about that when we talk about supporting other collection types.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    In the end, using <code>reduce</code> with a reducer function is simple enough because of <code>toReducer</code>.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    reduce([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], toReducer((acc, x) => acc + x), 0);
    // -> 15
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    So why, on a page about transduction, are we spending so much time on a function that does simple
    <em>re</em>duction? Because transduction is really nothing more than reduction, except with the ability to transform
    the reducer in a way to get the results you want.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, the transducers that xduce provides, when called without the shortcutting input collection, produce
    functions that take reducer objects and return reducer objects. Since they return reducer objects, those return
    values can be sent directly to <code>reduce</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, this isn't useful in most situations. After all, whether it returns a reducer or not, <code>map</code>
    only knows how to map values, not how to produce an output collection. But since each of the transducers produce
    functions that <em>take</em> reducers as well as return them, we can pass a reducer object to this function to
    produce a composed reducer that knows both how to map values and how to produce a collection from them.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    const reducer = toReducer([]);  // this is a reducer that knows how to make an array
    const xform = map(x => x + 1);
    reduce([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], xform(reducer), []);
    // -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Here, we've gotten the functon that <code>map</code> produces (called <code>xform</code>) and passed to it an
    array reduction function (called <code>reducer</code>). The result is another reducer, one that both does the
    mapping and creates the output array, that we duly pass into <code>reduce</code>. This is exactly how
    <code>transduce</code> operates, in fact &mdash; it takes the transducer and reducer that it is sent, combines
    them, and sends them to <code>reduce</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is pretty low-level stuff, and seldom should there be a time when it would actually be needed. If you don't
    quite understand what's going on with this reduction business, you're probably not missing much. But the facility
    is there if it's needed.
