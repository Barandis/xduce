  <h1>Composing transducers</h1>
  <p>
    Composition is putting together small, modular functions to produce more complex functions, and it's particularly important in collection manipulation. With composition, any combination and number of small functions can be joined together to accomplish virtually any transformation task without having to write a new function to do it. This is something that is not typically accentuated in regular JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the design goals of xduce is to make every transducer completely composable. In fact the way transducers do composition is much more efficient than the way it's accomplished in their normal list manipulation function counterparts.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      You might not realize it, but JavaScript's array functions are composable. It's just kinda hard to tell, because the term <em>compose</em> doesn't occur much in JavaScript documentation. Composition of array functions happens by chaining methods together, like this.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(x => x + 1).filter(x => x > 3);
      // -> [4, 5, 6]
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      This is a perfectly reasonable way to do composition in an object-oriented style. Xduce's style is different, more akin of purely functional programming languages.
    </p>
  </aside>

  <h2>The <code>compose</code> function</h2>
  <p>
    Xduce accomplishes composition through its <code>compose</code> function. It accepts any number of transducers and returns a single transducer that will accomplish everything that the individual ones would have done, in the same order. This transducer is exactly what's needed in a call to <code>transduce</code>, <code>into</code>, or <code>sequence</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This example shows the way that you would accomplish the above JavaScript array transformation with xduce.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    const xform = compose(map(x => x + 1), filter(x => x > 3));
    sequence([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], xform);
    // -> [4, 5, 6]
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    The result of the <code>compose</code> function is fed to <code>sequence</code> in exactly the same way that a single transducer would be. As far as <code>sequence</code> is concerned, there is no difference between a single transducer and a composed transducer, so you can make any kind of composition you want and have it work as you would expect.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <h3>A note on composition order</h3>
    <p>
      In most functional programming languages, data moves through a chain of composed functions from <em>right-to-left</em>. This is a fine way to do it, as it makes sense both from a mathematical standpoint (composition in math is also done right-to-left) and because the functions appear in the same order as they would if you chained their results together instead of composing them.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">
      // Assume `comp` to be a compose function in normal right-to-left order
      f(g(x));        // applied inside-out, g and then f
      comp(f, g)(x);  // applied right-to-left, also g and then f
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      But it's more natural to do transducers in a left-to-right order, more akin to reading English. This is in part because of the step-wise nature of transduction, lending itself to work with data sources where the data is not all available at the beginning of the transformation (like streams or channels). Because of that, the xduce <code>compose</code> function sends data through the functions left-to-right.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    Note that <code>compose</code> produces a <em>proper transducer</em>, a function that takes a reducer and returns another reducer, which is exactly the same thing that any of xduce's transducers (<code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, etc.) produce. But it does not have the ability to shortcut the way single transducers do. To use a composed transducer, you must send it to a transduction function like <code>sequence</code>; you cannot provide it a collection as the first argument and have it do everything itself.
  </p>

  <h2>Composition mechanics</h2>
  <p><em>
    This section doesn't tell you anything about how to use transducers, but it's important to know that composition, and particularly the way composition is done, is one of the key reasons to choose transducers over regular functions.
  </em></p>
  <p>
    Composition of regular list functions is an exercise in inefficiency. To see why, let's look at the same composition of JavaScript array functions as above, reprinted here for convenience.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(x => x + 1).filter(x => x > 3);
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    The process of executing this line of code goes something like this.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><code>map</code> breaks the input array into pieces</li>
    <li><code>map</code> adds 1 to each of those pieces</li>
    <li><code>map</code> puts the transformed pieces back together into a new array</li>
    <li><code>filter</code> breaks the new array into pieces</li>
    <li><code>filter</code> decides whether to send each piece to the output</li>
    <li><code>filter</code> puts the selected pieces back together into a new array</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The third and fourth steps create an array from pieces, and then break the array into pieces. In other words, they're completely unnecessary. And for every function added to the composition chain, another unnecessary new array is constructed, and then another unnecessary iteration step is used to break it apart again.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is necessary with normal array functions because they're completely self-contained. You cannot tell <code>map</code> not to create a new array, and you cannot tell <code>filter</code> that it will be recieving separate pieces as input rather than an entire array. Since the breakdown and buildup of arrays are an integral part of these functions, they always have to happen, even when they're not needed.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      Note that even in list-based languages, where these kinds of manipulations are commonplace and are therefore   made quite efficient, this problem still exists. Even the same operation in Haskell
    </p>
    <pre><code class="haskell">
      filter (>3) . map (+1) $ [1..5]
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      will produce an intermediate list that is then discarded.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    Transducers move the breakdown and buildup out of the transducer and into other functions (specifically, functions like <code>transduce</code>, <code>into</code>, and <code>sequence</code> handle those aspects). The transducer itself handles only transformation, and it does that transformation one piece at a time. Let's again see the xduce equivalent of the above JavaScript array manipulation.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    const xform = compose(map(x => x + 1), filter(x => x > 3));
    sequence([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], xform);
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    This process looks more like this.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><code>sequence</code> breaks the input array into pieces</li>
    <li><code>map</code> receives one piece at a time, transforming it and sending it to <code>filter</code></li>
    <li>
      <code>filter</code> receives one piece at a time from <code>map</code>, deciding whether to send the piece back to <code>sequence</code>
    </li>
    <li><code>sequence</code> puts the pieces passed from <code>filter</code> together into a new array</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The intermediate array, both its construction and its breaking up, is gone. No matter how many transducers are chained together into a single composition, there will be exactly one new collection created, and that's the output collection.
  </p>
