  <h1>Introduction to xduce</h1>
  <p>
    xduce is a JavaScript implementation of a transducer library. Transducers were all the rage a couple of years
    ago when they found a use with the much-hyped (deservedly so) addition of
    <abbr title="Communicating Sequential Processes">CSP</abbr> to Clojure's core.async library. JavaScript lends
    itself to nearly any sort of library, and unsurprisingly, a few transducer libraries popped up in the next few
    months, normally accompanied by a CSP library of their own.
  </p>
  <p>
    xduce isn't necessarily late to the party. CSP and transducers piqued my interest right from the beginning,
    and while I remained interested, the libraries that were around started to age and stopped being maintained.
    Eventually I decided to write libraries of each of my own in an attempt to improve upon them and to have an
    actively maintained one.
  </p>

  <h2>So...what is it good for?</h2>
  <p>
    Alright, so xduce is a transducer library. Why do you need a transducer library? Why was it cool enough to
    spend all this time working on it? For in-depth answers, you might want to go to the
    <a href="#manual/theory">Theory</a> page, but here's a nice high-level answer that's much shorter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Transducers let you do all of the things that you would normally do with <code>map</code>,
    <code>filter</code>, and all those other mainstays of functional programming <em>without caring about what
    kind of collection you have</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    With normal JavaScript functions, you have to use a different <code>filter</code> function (for instance)
    for each different collection type. <code>Array.prototype.filter</code> will not work on strings, and if you
    wrote a function to filter characters from strings, it would not work on plain objects. That's because, while
    you can customize the rule for determining whether an array element is filtered out or not, you
    <em>cannot</em> customize how <code>Array.prototype.filter</code> breaks an array into its parts before you
    run each of those parts through a filtering function, nor can you customize how the new array is put back
    together from the filtered parts.
  </p>
  <p>
    xduce lets you do both of those things. The upshot is that the very same <code>filter</code> that xduce
    provides can be used on arrays, strings, objects, or generators without any modification or setup.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    const { filter } = xduce.transducers;

    // Works with arrays out of the box!
    filter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], x => x > 2);         // [3, 4, 5]
    // Works with strings out of the box!
    filter('Hello', x => x === x.toLowerCase()); // 'ello'
    // Works with objects out of the box!
    filter({ a: 1, b: 2 }, { k, v } => v > 1);   // { b: 2 }
    // Works with generators out of the box!
    function* five() {
      for (let i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) {
        yield i;
      }
    }
    filter(five(), x => x > 2);   // iterator containing 3, 4, 5
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    It can also be used on any other collection type, or any collection type that doens't yet exist but will in
    the future, just by providing 3-4 properties (a line of code or two each) to instruct xduce on how to work
    with that collection type.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="javascript">
    const { compose, protocols, sequence } = xduce;
    const { filter, map, take } = xduce.transducers;
    const { List } = Immutable;

    // Works with immutable-js lists, with a little setup
    List.prototype[protocols.init] = () => List().asMutable();
    List.prototype[protocols.step] = (acc, x) => acc.push(x);
    List.prototype[protocols.result] = x => x.asImmutable();

    filter(List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), x => x > 2);  // List(3, 4, 5)
    // Better yet, setting up once means any transducer will work now
    map(List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), x => x + 1);     // List(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
    take(List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), 3);             // List(1, 2, 3)

    const fn = compose(map(x => x + 1), take(3));
    sequence(List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), fn);        // List(2, 3, 4)
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    As you can see from the examples at the bottom, once a type has support for transducers, it has support for
    <em>all</em> transducers. There are currently 21 available in xduce, and they can all be composed in any
    number and order you like, and all will work with any type of collection.
  </p>

<section id="csp">
  <h2>Special mention: channels</h2>
  <p>
    The very reason I originally started xduce was as a companion to the JavaScript implementation of
    Communicating Sequencial Processes (CSP) that I was creating, which eventually became
    <a href="https://barandis.github.io/cispy">Cispy</a>. This was not an accident. Clojure famously added CSP to
    its core.async library, and shortly thereafter, they released transducers to help with transforming values on
    CSP channels. Since I had the benefit of seeing that all happen, I knew when I began with CSP that I would
    want transducers from the start.
  </p>
  <p>
    CSP channels are not like other collections. You can't create a new channel with transformed elements from
    the old channel...the elements appear on the input channel over time, like a stream, and anyone who is
    interested in taking values off the channel will be listening to the original channel, not to some new one
    that transducers create.
  </p>
  <p>
    So there is specific support in Cispy channels to have a transducer attached to them when they're created.
    The values are transformed by the transducer as they're taken off, one at a time.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    const { chan, go, put, take } = cispy;
    const { map } = xduce.transducers;

    const ch = chan(1, map(x => x + 1));

    go(function*() {
      yield put(ch, 1);
      yield put(ch, 5);
    });

    go(function*() {
      const first  = yield take(ch);   // first = 2
      const second = yield take(ch);   // second = 6
    });
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    The different nature of channels means the setup is different, but the <em>exact same</em> transducers are
    used with channels as are with arrays, strings, and anything else.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use transducers without ever caring about CSP channels, but if you're using CSP, you're definitely
    going to want transducers.
