  <h1>Protocols and support for other collections</h1>
  <p>
    The iteration protocols have been mentioned a few times, but we haven't spent much time on just what a protocol is.
  </p>
  <p>
    A protocol, something which was first brought up in JavaScript for ES2015, isn't too dissimilar from an interface
    in a class-based language. It's a set of properties that an object agrees to implement in order to statisfy the
    protocol; the iterable property, for example, says that an object has to have a function property with a particular
    name that returns an iterator, and if it does that, it gets to play with <code>for...of</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Xduce implements its support for iterating over any collection through the use of these iterator protocols. Any
    collection that conforms can be broken down by <code>transduce</code> and friends, and any collection that doesn't
    conform can be made to conform (more on that in a little bit).
  </p>
  <p>
    But there are no built-in reduction protocols, no universal way to reduce to a collection in the same way that there
    is a universal way to iterate over a collection. Fortunately, we have the ability to define our own protocols, and
    that's exactly what xduce does to let it both iterate over and reduce into any collection type.
  </p>

  <h2>Making your collection iterate</h2>
  <p>
    This is really not too hard at all. JavaScript already tells us how to make a collection iterable by implementing
    the iteration protocols. In fact, it's difficult to find a collection these days that doesn't implement the
    iterator protocols, so we're going to have to pretend that we need to give a collection iterator support.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're just going to pretend that arrays are not iterable, and we'll show how to make them that way. While that's
    pretty non-sensical, it does show exactly what you would have to do to make your own collection iterable.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      It might be reasonable to guess that xduce already supports pre-ES2015 arrays, which were not iterable because no
      iterable protocol existed yet, and that would be a correct guess. You will not have to actually implement this
      protocol on an array even if you're in a pre-ES2015 environment.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    The <em>iterable</em> protocol (one of the two iteration protocols) says that to be iterable, an object needs to
    have a property with a certain name that is a function that returns an iterator. That name is
    <code>Symbol.iterator</code>. This is a symbol, not a string, and symbols are very often used for protocol property
    names (they have no literal form, so you actually have to reference the property as <code>Symbol.iterator</code>).
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      In a pre-ES2015 environment, where symbols don't exist, xduce will instead look for a property called
      <code>'@@iterator'</code>. It's expected to return an object with a <code>next</code> function just like one that
      actually conforms to the iterable protocol.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    We need our function to return an object with a <code>next</code> function on it, and that <code>next</code>
    function needs to return the contents of the array, one element at a time, as the <code>value</code> property of
    an object. This is the <em>iterator</em> protocol, the other iteration protocol. It's pretty easy to implement by
    keeping track of the index of the last value to have been returned.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      We're going to be adding properties to a built-in object here, <code>Array</code>. This is generally considered
      bad practice. However, it's a much less bad practice when doing it with properties named with symbols, as the
      chance of there being a name collision &mdash; the biggest reason why we don't normally want to add properties
      to built-in objects &mdash; is negligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said, even with symbols, you don't actually want to write this code. It turns out that
      <code>Array</code> <em>does</em> have a symbol named <code>Symbol.iterator</code>, and here we are overwriting
      it.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = () => {
      let index = 0;
      const array = this;

      return {
        next() {
          return index &lt; array.length
            ? {
                value: array[index++],
                done: false
              }
            : {
                done: true
              };
        }
      };
    }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    And that's all there is to it. We track the current index and keep a reference to the array (because
    <code>this</code> inside our returned function will <em>not</em> be the array), and each time <code>next</code> is
    called, we return the value at the index and increment that index. The value is wrapped up in an object that
    satisfies the iterator protocol. When there are no more elements left, <code>next</code> returns
    <code>{ done: true }</code>, just as the protocol requires.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      Note that the function was added to <code>Array</code>'s prototype. This is a common way to do things because it
      means that any new array created after this function was added will have that function as a part of it, and will
      therefore be iterable. But there's nothing preventing you from instead adding the function to a particular
      instance of an array instead of to the prototype; it'll just mean that only that instance of the array will be
      iterable.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    In reality, these days, even most third-party collections implement the iteration protocols. But if you create your
    own, or if you come across one that doesn't, you can add the ability in exactly the same way. Not only will your
    collection then be iterable by xduce, it will also be able to be used in <code>for...of</code>.
  </p>

  <h2>Making your collection reduce</h2>
  <p>
    This part is trickier, because we don't have any built-in support from JavaScript. For this section we're going to
    use a real-life collection that you might want to actually make work with xduce, the <code>List</code> from
    <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">Immutable</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make a collection reducible by xduce, it needs to provide instructions on how to reduce it. This has two parts:
    the initial value, and a function that's run once for each element to add it to the collection that's being built.
    This probably doesn't sound too odd; it's pretty much the definition of reduction itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are no protocols in JavaScript for reduction, so xduce has created its own. These are available on the
    <code>xduce.protocols</code> object. To provide a new initial collection, the collection should implement
    <code>xduce.protocols.init</code>, and reduction should be done via a reduction function called
    <code>xduce.protocols.step</code>. Let's show how to do that with Immutable lists.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      The actual names in <code>xduce.protocols</code> are symbols, as long as you're in an environment where symbols
      are available. The cool thing about symbols is that they're absolutely unique, so no one could possibly ever
      create another symbol with the same name as, for instance, <code>xduce.protocols.init</code>. This completely
      eliminates accidental name clashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're working in an ES5 environment without symbols, string names will have to be used, and xduce adjusts
      accordingly to provide some names that start with <code>'@@transducer/'</code>. Hopefully that will make it
      unlikely to have a name clash, but unfortunately without symbols it's always possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, remember us using <code>Symbol.iterator</code> and the comment that xduce will look for
      <code>'@@iterator</code> instead if symbols don't exist? Well, you don't have to remember those names. You can
      use <code>xduce.protocols.iterator</code>, which will return the right name &mdash; symbol or string &mdash;
      depending on your environment.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    const List = Immutable.List;
    const { init, step } = xduce.protocols;

    List.prototype[init] = () => List();
    List.prototype[step] = (acc, x) => List.fromJS(acc.toArray().concat([x]));
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    The <code>init</code> function simply returns a new <code>List</code>. There's nothing unusual about that.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      Do note however that the <code>init</code> property is a <em>function that returns a new <code>List</code></em>,
      not a <code>List</code> itself. This is because the property will likely be called several times, and we want it
      to provide a new empty <code>List</code> each time.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    The <code>step</code> function is where the magic happens. In this case, it turns the accumulator (the current
    <code>List</code> as it's being build) into an array, concatenates the new value to the end of it, and calls
    <code>List.fromJS</code> to create a new list from that array.
  </p>
  <p>
    And...there's a problem. Because Immutable lists are, well, immutable, the only way to reduce to them is to create
    a new list for every step (since we can't modify the old list). This really isn't very efficient. But Immutable
    does provide a different way, by making their immutable lists mutable.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    List.prototype[init] = () => List().asMutable();
    List.prototype[step] = (acc, x) => acc.push(x);
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Well, that's certainly going to be more efficient, and it's easier to read to boot (thanks to the fact that
    <code>List</code>'s <code>push</code> function returns the new <code>List</code>, unlike JavaScript's
    <code>Array</code>'s <code>push</code>). But the problem here is that we're not making an immutable list at all.
    The list that gets returned is mutable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The solution is a <em>third</em> protocol function, this one called <code>xduce.protocols.result</code>. When the
    reduction is complete and the finsihed collection is ready to be returned, <code>result</code> gives us one last
    chance to modify the collection as a whole before it's sent back. Let's see how we can use that to get the best of
    both worlds.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
    const List = Immutable.List;
    const { init, step, result } = xduce.protocols;

    List.prototype[init] = () => List().asMutable();
    List.prototype[step] = (acc, x) => acc.push(x);
    List.prototype[result] = acc => acc.asImmutable();
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    There! The <code>result</code> function has given us that last chance to take the mutable list that we've been
    building up so efficiently and turn it into an immutable list for return. Realized that this is not actually just a
    demonstration &mdash; if you want to use Immutable lists with xduce, those three lines of code above are exactly
    how to make that happen.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      In case you wondered, this is perfectly okay even from a functional purity standpoint (where <em>everything</em>
      is supposed to be immutable). Mutability only matters if something can take advantage of it, and that's not the
      case here. The list is only mutable when we're working on it; by the time any outside code gets a glimpse of it,
      it's already immutable.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>
    Most of the time, the <code>result</code> function is just going to return the accumulator as-is, because there's
    no need to modify it before return. You will still need to provide a <code>result</code> function though, even if
    the code for it is just <code>x => x</code>. For a collection like this though, where we want to build in an
    efficient way that precludes the type that we're outputting, it's invaluable.

  <h2>Making your own collections work with xduce</h2>
  <p>
    We've covered all you need to do to make xduce able to work with a third-party collection, but let's consolidate
    that into an easy-to-use list.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Give your collection (either directly, or on a prototype object if you're using them and want <em>all</em>
      instances of your collection to be iterable) a function property called <code>xduce.protocols.iterator</code>
      that returns an object that conforms to the iterator protocol. You will probably find that most collections
      already implement this. (Remember that in an environment with symbols, this is the same as
      <code>Symbol.iterator</code>, so any collection that implements that will conform to what xduce needs.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Give your collection a function property named <code>xduce.protocols.init</code>. When called, it should provide
      a new instance of an empty collection.
    </li>
    <li>
      Give your collection a function property named <code>xduce.protocols.step</code>. It should be a reducer function,
      appending a new value onto the collection when called.
    </li>
    <li>
      Give your collection a function property named <code>xduce.protocols.result</code>. It should take a collection
      and return the collection that you would want returned from that input collection. Note that in the vast
      majority of cases, this function should just return its input argument unchanged.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Any collection that you can do this with &mdash; and it's not really a very hard task &mdash; can then be used with
    xduce. And as long as you add it to the prototype so that the functions appear on every new object created from
    that prototype, it's a one time deal. Do it once, and every transducer will work with your collection.
  </p>
