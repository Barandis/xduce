  <p><em>
    Here it is: the answers to all of your questions about xduce and transducers in general. Or at least it should
    be. If you have a question to which you can't find the answer in here, then please
    <a href="https://github.com/Barandis/xduce/issues">enter an issue</a> to let me know how I can change this for
    the better.
